# Main moto for this project:
I'm a university student who lives out side of the college. When I first joined i couldnt get the hostel rooms so i had to find the PG rooms physically which is so exhaustive.
So i came up with an idea to provide the information of all the PGs which are near students who are going to take a room in PG. This helps the students to get less tired to find rooms to stay.
